# Linear Algebra

## Introduction
Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vectors, vector spaces, and linear transformations.

## Vectors
A vector is an ordered collection of numbers that can represent a point in space, a direction, or any quantity that has both magnitude and direction.
### [Vector Operations](./VectorOps.java)
- **Addition**: Adding two vectors by adding their corresponding components.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracting one vector from another by subtracting their corresponding components.
- **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplying a vector by a scalar (a single number), scaling its magnitude.
- **Dot Product**: A measure of similarity between two vectors, calculated as the sum of the products of their corresponding components.

## Matrices
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are used to represent linear transformations and systems of linear equations.
### [Matrix Operations](./MatrixOps.java)
- **Addition**: Adding two matrices by adding their corresponding elements.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracting one matrix from another by subtracting their corresponding elements.
- **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplying a matrix by a scalar, scaling all its elements.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Combining two matrices to produce a new matrix, following specific rules for multiplication.
- **Transpose**: Flipping a matrix over its diagonal, switching its rows with columns.
- **Echelon Form:** A form of a matrix where all non-zero rows are above any rows of all zeros, and the leading coefficient of each non-zero row is to the right of the leading coefficient of the previous row.
- **Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF):** An advanced form of echelon form where the leading coefficient in each non-zero row is 1, and is the only non-zero entry in its column.
