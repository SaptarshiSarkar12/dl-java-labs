# Deep Learning From Scratch (Java-first)

This repository documents my deep learning journey through:
- Concept breakdowns
- Mathematical intuition
- From-scratch implementations (mostly in Java)

Each section is aligned with a LinkedIn post where I summarize insights and lessons learned.

## Motivation
The goal of this repository is to develop a deep, first-principles understanding of deep learning rather than relying on high-level abstractions.

## Why Java?
To deeply understand what happens under the hood instead of relying on black-box libraries.

## Repository Organization

- [Fundamentals](./src/main/java/fundamentals) - Basic concepts and mathematical foundations.
  - [Linear Algebra](./src/main/java/fundamentals/linearalgebra) - Vectors and Matrices Operations
- [Neural Networks](./src/main/java/neuralnetworks) - Building blocks of neural networks.
    - [Perceptron](./src/main/java/neuralnetworks/perceptron) - Single-layer neural network implementation.
        - [McCulloch-Pitts Neuron](./src/main/java/neuralnetworks/perceptron/MPNeuron.java) - Basic binary classifier.

## Learning Sources
- MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005 (Lecture Videos) by **Gilbert Strang** (YouTube)
- Deep Learning playlist by **NPTEL** (YouTube)
- Additional articles, papers, and references as needed

## Status
🚧 Actively learning and building.  
This repository will be updated incrementally as concepts are implemented.
